## Step 1

In this folder, I would like you to scaffold a new wordpress plugin that adds new feature to wordpress blog editors ( classic & gutenberg ). The name of the plugin shoudl be AI Blog Summary Generator

The plugin should have a the following structure and technology stack

- basic folder structure it can be expandable to accept more files/folders
    - assets/
        - frontend/
            - css/
                - index.css
            - js/
                - index.js
        - admin/
            - css/
                - index.css
            - js/
                - index.js
    - ai-blog-summary.php
    - readme.txt

- technology stack
    - php as default as it is wordpress
    - tailwindcss for styling
    - react for adding dynamic js & for more interactivity
    - vite for compiliting css/js assets to browser renderable format
    - composer setup for adding php packages
    

I have already created root  plugin folder, and we are currently in it, so don't worry about that.

## Step 4
    - Thunderblot news
    - want to add additional meta data in posts editors like gutenberge or classic editor
      it will be a check box with label "add news to thunderbolt" and store that value in posts meta data
    - create a short code the content that I want to show in short code are the 10 latest  posts that have thunderbolt meta data value as true 
    - the way I want is in which ever page this short code got added I don't want to show any header and footer of the that page instead the short code should cover the whole page content the bg should be dynamic and should given an option in plugin settings page add a new tab thunderbolt page under that give option to choose page bg color 
    by default set background as black and the post should be shown in different style 
    as per device viewport
    if the device view port is desktop 
      then want to show those ten posts in horizontal scroll way in the active slide only three posts should be shown on the excat center with a bit zoom in scale and rest two should show half in the left and right side and navigation arrows should be on the right side 
    if the device view port is tablet mode 
      then only one post at the center of the screen and navigation o the right side (navigation arrows left and right arrow)
    if the device is mobile 
       then only one post with 100vh height should be shown at a time but slider should be vertical users should swipe up and down to see the posts in mobile don't want to show navigation arrows
